            <p>
                I am a full stack developer who is passionate about learning and working on a 
                team that encourages collaboration, questions, and growth. I have worked in 
                both Travel and Education in the past and would love to work on something that 
                helps traveling and/or education be simple and accessible for all. At the end 
                of the day though, I thrive when I can build products that are helpful and 
                meaningful to others. I like to be behind the scenes thinking about the bigger 
                picture- how can a user get the most efficient and smooth experience from this 
                product? I enjoy working in Python, Java, JavaScript, and React, and am always 
                excited to learn new languages and frameworks as I grow.
